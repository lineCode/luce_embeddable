Embeddable luce

USAGE:

create a squishy containing all the required classes

run ./make [options]

Options:

    XCROSS :    compile for Win* via mingw
    STATIC :    statically compiled binary, with luce fully embedded
    LUA52  :    (mingw only): compile with lua52
    TNAME  :    name of the binary (default: demo)
                note: when STATIC is set, binary name results in $(TNAME)_s$(EXT)
                      when LUA52 is set, binary name results in $(TNAME)52$(EXT)
                      and when both are set, binary name results in $(TNAME)52_s$(EXT)

By default, compile a Linux glibc 2.13 compatible binary depending on core.so.
